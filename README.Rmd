## Coding style

### Our usual script preamble:
At the beginning of each script, we usually have these lines:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # includes packages: ggplot2, tibble, tidyr, readr, purrr, dplyr, and forcats
library(broom)      # functions: tidy(), glance(), augment()
```

To see more information about any package or function, move your cursor to it and press F1.

### The pipe operator - %>%:

*(Image source: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html )*

The pipe operator ( `%>%` ) sends an R object (usually a data frame) into a function. You can type it up, or you can use the keyboard short-cut of `Control+Shift+M`. It looks a bit scary at first, but once you get used to it you won't want to do R any other way.


Let's load some example data (the `diamonds` dataset that comes with `ggplot2`):



```{r}

mydata = diamonds

# or equivalently
mydata <- diamonds

# or equivalently
diamonds -> mydata

```
(We tend to use the `=` rather than `<-`, but sometimes we do use the left-to-right arrow: `->`.)


You can summarise a data frame like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
summary(mydata)
```

Or write the same thing using a pipe:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mydata %>% summary()
```


This might not seem that useful at first as `mydata %>% summary()` is actually longer than `summary(mydata)`. Nevertheless, piping becomes very useful when doing a few manipulations after another or filtering data before summarising it.

For example, look at this line:
```{r}
summary(select(filter(mydata, cut %in% c("Premium", "Ideal")), cut, price))
```
(`cut %in% c('Premium', 'Ideal')` is equivalent to `cut == 'Premium' | cut == 'Ideal'`, `|` means **or**)

It is quite hard to figure out what is going on there. Writing the exact same workflow out with pipes makes it (human) readable:

```{r}
mydata %>% 
  filter(cut %in% c("Premium", "Ideal")) %>% 
  select(cut, price) %>% 
  summary()

```
Reading this: Take `mydata` and filter for cuts that are either "Premium" or "Ideal", select `cut` and `price`, and summarise.


## `->`: 

Once you really get into piped workflows it starts making sense to use the left-to-right assignment arrow `->`:

```{r}
mydata %>% 
  filter(cut %in% c("Premium", "Ideal")) %>% 
  select(cut, price) ->
  mydata_highquality
```

is equivalent to:

```{r}
mydata_highquality = mydata %>% 
  filter(cut %in% c("Premium", "Ideal")) %>% 
  select(cut, price)
```
